# OCRConversation

**What it intends to do:**
The idea behind this is to test if I could create a conversation with a model based on images of hand written questions or instructions. For that, the user writes down a certain question or instruction, and shows the paper sheet to the camera. The camera takes a photo of the paper, applies OCR to it and checks if the question / instruction meets anything in the knowledge base. 


**Future work:**

- Assess the right font to be read by the algo
- Increase number of questions / answers pairs
- Redefine the user interface to be more nice
- Try to make the snapshot to be take upon pressing the spacebar
